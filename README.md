This repository contains code for applying domain adaptation to IDRR models via pseudo-labeling techniques.

We domain adapt and use/modify the source code of the following models:

1. LDSGM - https://github.com/nlpersECJTU/LDSGM/tree/main

2. GOLF - https://github.com/YJiangcm/GOLF_for_IDRR

3. Our pseudo-labeling framework is based on Nishida and Matsumoto, 2022 (https://github.com/norikinishida/discourse-parsing)
